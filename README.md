# scrutineer

A local tool for scanning open source repositories for security vulnerabilities and managing the disclosure process. You add a repo by URL, scrutineer runs a pipeline of [claude-code skills](https://agentskills.io) against it, and presents the results in a web UI where you can triage findings, identify maintainers, and track disclosures.

## Quick start

You need [Go 1.26+](https://go.dev/dl/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) running.

    git clone https://github.com/alpha-omega-security/scrutineer
    cd scrutineer

Authenticate Claude with one of two options:

**Option A: Claude Code subscription** (Max, Pro, Team, or Enterprise) -- generate a long-lived OAuth token with the [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code):

    claude setup-token
    export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-...

**Option B: Anthropic API key** from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com):

    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

Then start scrutineer:

    export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://...  # optional: custom API endpoint
    go run ./cmd/scrutineer -skills ./skills

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Scrutineer detects Docker and starts using it automatically: each scan runs in an ephemeral container with a read-only source mount and an egress allowlist proxy. The runner image (`ghcr.io/alpha-omega-security/scrutineer-runner`) is pulled on first use, so the first scan is slower while it downloads. If Docker isn't available scans run directly on the host with no isolation; see the Security section before doing that.

Click **Add repository** in the sidebar, paste a git HTTPS URL, and scrutineer enqueues the `triage` skill. To scan a maintained branch instead of the default, fill the **Branch** field (it suggests the remote's branches as you type and also accepts a tag or commit), or append a `/tree/<branch>` suffix to the URL; the suffix also works one-per-line when bulk-importing. Triage then enqueues the rest of the pipeline in parallel. Metadata and package lookups finish in seconds; the security deep-dive takes a few minutes depending on repo size. Open the repo page and switch to the Scans tab to watch progress, or wait for the Findings tab to fill in.

To onboard a whole GitHub org at once, open **Add multiple** → **Import a whole org** and enter the org (or user) login. Scrutineer fetches every repository and queues each one with the default scan set, skipping forks and archived repos unless you opt in. Duplicates already in the database are skipped. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise GitHub's unauthenticated rate limit when importing large orgs.

You can also scan a directory on disk, useful before pushing, or for code not hosted on a git forge. Paste an absolute path (`/path/to/project`) in the same **Add repository** field. Scrutineer copies the directory into a per-scan workspace and runs the default skill set; skills that need a forge URL or ecosyste.ms enrichment (`advisories`, `exposure`, `fork`, `maintainers`, `metadata`, `packages`, `public-issue`, `report-upstream`) are skipped automatically. Symlinks are recreated as-is rather than dereferenced during the copy; in container mode their targets then resolve inside the container, so host files reached only through such a link are not visible to skills. Under `--no-container` the kernel dereferences them normally, so only point scrutineer at trees you trust.

The optional analysis tools (semgrep, zizmor, git-pkgs, brief) are bundled in the runner image, so you don't need them installed locally when the container runner is in use.

## Git authentication

Scrutineer shells out to `git clone` with no explicit token passing, so it uses whatever credentials are already configured on the host: SSH keys, credential helpers, `gh auth login`, a `.netrc` file, or the macOS keychain.

To scan private repos, make sure `git clone https://github.com/org/repo` works in your terminal before adding the URL to scrutineer. If it does, scrutineer can clone it too.

Common setups:

    # GitHub CLI (easiest)
    gh auth login

    # Git credential helper
    git config --global credential.helper store   # or osxkeychain / manager-core

    # SSH-based clone URLs are not supported -- scrutineer only accepts https:// URLs.
    # Use a credential helper to authenticate HTTPS clones instead.

When running inside Docker (`docker run ...`), the container has no access to host credentials. Mount a credential store or set `GIT_ASKPASS` to provide access to private repos from inside the container.

When the containerised runner is active (the default when a container runtime is available), each scan runs in a separate container but the clone happens on the host before the source is mounted in. Host credentials are used for the clone; the container never sees them.

## Features

### Scanning and analysis

- **Skill-based scan pipeline** -- every scan is a claude-code skill on disk (SKILL.md + schema + optional scripts). The default pipeline for a new repo is itself a skill (`triage`) that enqueues the others; edit its SKILL.md to change what runs
- **Structured findings** -- vulnerability reports parsed into a database with severity, CWE, location (linked to source), affected versions, and a six-step analysis trace
- **Threat model view** -- the project's security contract (components, entry-point trust table, properties provided and disclaimed, known non-findings) rendered from the `threat-model` scan, falling back to the deep-dive's boundaries and sink inventory on older repositories
- **Dependency exploration** -- dependency and dependent tables with one-click import to scan any package's source repository
- **Package registry data** -- downloads, dependents, versions, and registry links for every published package
- **Known advisories** -- existing CVEs and security advisories pulled automatically
- **Maintainer identification** -- model-backed skill combining commit history, issue/PR activity, and registry ownership to identify who to contact for disclosure
- **CWE catalogue** -- embedded MITRE CWE data with tooltips on finding tables and full descriptions on finding pages
- **Reachability analysis** -- trace sinks found in dependencies through application code to see which are actually reachable
- **Rescan dedup** -- findings carry a content fingerprint so re-running a scan updates existing rows instead of creating duplicates; same-fingerprint hits within one scan collapse to a single finding with a `+N` expandable location list, and findings that stop appearing are marked "not seen" with a miss count

### Triage and disclosure workflow

- **Finding workflow** -- guided triage flow from new through verification, disclosure, and publication with human gates at each step
- **Cheap-classifier pre-sort** -- the `revalidate` skill auto-enqueues for High/Critical deep-dive findings and every imported finding, emitting `true_positive` / `false_positive` / `already_fixed` / `uncertain` plus an optional severity adjustment; a `true_positive` on a High/Critical finding chains into `verify` automatically
- **Audit queue** -- random sample of recent low and false-positive verdicts at `/audit` so the operator can spot-check the classifier; each review records an agreement-or-overturn verdict on the finding
- **Exploited-in-the-wild flag** -- analyst-only `yes`/`no` field on findings with free-text evidence, surfaced on the finding page, in the OSV `database_specific` block, in CSAF audit notes, and in markdown report exports
- **Breaking-change classifier** -- the `breaking-change` skill runs over a suggested-fix diff plus the top dependents, recording `breaking` / `non_breaking` / `unknown` with a rationale and the list of affected dependents
- **Mitigation guidance** -- the `mitigate` skill drafts short-term workarounds and an optional semgrep rule per finding, separate from the code fix
- **CVSS v3.1 and v4.0** -- both vectors stored side by side with derived scores; analyst form, OSV/CSAF exports, and the `disclose` skill all carry both forward, with the v4 metric set kept distinct from v3
- **Release watch** -- the `release-watch` skill closes the gap between fix-landed and fix-shipped: once a finding reaches `fixed`, the skill polls upstream releases and records the release tag, URL, and timestamp when it appears
- **CNA matching** -- identify the CVE Numbering Authority whose scope covers a repo so disclosures go to the right contact
- **Upstream reporting** -- file a finding on the upstream repository through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting with the proposed patch attached, and push the fix to the temporary private fork when GitHub grants access. A PVR report is hard to unsend; before pointing this at an external repository, run it once end-to-end against a repository you control with PVR enabled to confirm the body shape and patch attachment land the way you expect. When upstream has no PVR available, follow the runbook in [docs/disclosure-fallback.md](docs/disclosure-fallback.md)

### Imports and exports

- **SBOM import** -- upload a CycloneDX or SPDX document, resolve each component to a source repository, and queue scans automatically
- **Finding import** -- POST SARIF, CSV, markdown, or minimal-JSON findings from external scanners and pentest reports into the same workflow as native scans, with fingerprint dedup against re-imports
- **Free-form ingest** -- when the format sniffer in `/api/v1/import` cannot place a payload, the `ingest` skill normalises it against the source checkout (resolving locations) before it enters the findings table
- **CSAF export** -- download any finding as a schema-validated CSAF 2.0 advisory document
- **OSV export** -- download any finding as a schema-validated OSV record, aligned with the OSS-SIRT advisory template (credits, CWE IDs, withdrawn, SEMVER ranges, CVSS v3 + v4 severity entries)
- **JSONL export** -- stream all findings or scans as line-delimited JSON for ingestion elsewhere
- **Markdown report export** -- download a single consolidated `report.md` per repository or organisation
- **Disclosure bundle** -- download `bundle.tar.gz` per finding: OSV, CSAF, markdown report, patch.diff, and a manifest naming the contents; ready to hand to a coordinator or attach to a private email when filing outside GitHub PVR

### Operational

- **Containerised runner** -- optional per-scan container isolation with read-only source mounts, dropped capabilities, and an authenticated egress allowlist proxy
- **Skill HTTP API** -- running skills can call back into scrutineer to list prior scans and enqueue further skills; surface documented in `openapi.yaml`
- **Live updates** -- SSE streaming of scan logs and status changes, no polling
- **Organisation rollup** -- repos, findings, and maintainers grouped by owning org, with per-org markdown exports
- **Usage tracking** -- per-scan token and cost figures plus a `/usage` page totalling spend per skill
- **Themes** -- six colour themes plus a light/dark/system toggle, set on the Settings page

## The default pipeline

When a repo is added, the `triage` skill is enqueued. Its SKILL.md lists the skills to trigger. The bundled skills live in `skills/`:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `triage` | Orchestrates the default scan set via the scrutineer API |
| `metadata` | Fetches repo metadata from repos.ecosyste.ms |
| `packages` | Looks up published packages from packages.ecosyste.ms |
| `advisories` | Fetches known security advisories |
| `dependencies` | Runs `git-pkgs list` to index every manifest |
| `sbom` | Runs `git-pkgs sbom` for a CycloneDX SBOM |
| `maintainers` | Model-backed analysis identifying real maintainers and contact routes |
| `repo-overview` | Runs `brief --json` for a structured project summary |
| `subprojects` | Enumerates monorepo packages/workspaces so deep-dives can be scoped to a sub-path |
| `threat-model` | Derives the project's security contract (components, entry-point trust table, claimed and disclaimed properties) for the deep-dive to load |
| `semgrep` | Static analysis mapped into findings shape |
| `vuln-scan` | High-recall model-backed static candidate scan adapted from Anthropic's defending-code reference harness |
| `zizmor` | GitHub Actions workflow audit mapped into findings shape |
| `ingest` | Normalizes external reports in arbitrary formats into findings when `/v1/import` cannot recognise the payload |
| `security-deep-dive` | The model-backed audit producing structured findings |
| `finding-dedup` | Compares open findings and marks overlapping reports as duplicates |
| `verify` | Re-checks one finding against current HEAD; records reproduces / fixed / can't-reproduce |
| `revalidate` | Cheap read-only classifier (prose + `git log`, no PoC execution) that emits true / false positive / already-fixed / uncertain; auto-enqueued for High/Critical from `security-deep-dive` and for every imported finding. A `true_positive` on a High/Critical finding chains automatically to `verify` |
| `breaking-change` | Static breaking-change check on the suggested-fix diff; records `breaking`/`non_breaking`/`unknown` with rationale and the affected dependents |
| `release-watch` | After a finding reaches `fixed`, watches the upstream for a release containing the fix commit; records release tag, URL, and timestamp on the finding |
| `disclose` | Drafts a GHSA-shaped advisory (title, description, CVSS, CWEs, references) for one finding |
| `patch` | Proposes a unified diff fixing one finding; a diff that passes the applicability gate is stored on the finding as its suggested fix |
| `report-upstream` | Files one finding on the upstream repository via GitHub PVR with the proposed patch attached; the action that moves a finding to `reported` |
| `public-issue` | Files a low-severity finding as an ordinary public GitHub issue after analyst confirmation |
| `reachability` | Traces dependency sinks through application code to determine which are reachable from trust boundaries |
| `cna-match` | Matches a repository to its CVE Numbering Authority so disclosures route to the right contact |
| `posture` | Records the repo's security posture (reporting policy, response history, hardening) on the Repository row |

Edit `skills/triage/SKILL.md` to change what gets run by default. Drop new skill directories in `skills/` to add scan types; no code changes needed. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for the frontmatter reference, the `scrutineer.*` metadata keys, the `context.json` shape, output kinds, schema validation, and the skill-facing HTTP API.

Before each scan, lockfiles, minified bundles, and generated trees are stripped from the workspace so the skill doesn't waste turns on them. The builtin skip list covers `node_modules`, `dist`, `generated`, `__generated__`, `*.min.js`/`*.min.css`, and the common lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, `Gemfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `composer.lock`). Skills can override this with `scrutineer.paths` (allow-list) and layer `scrutineer.ignore_paths` on top; see [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md#path-filtering).

## Importing findings from other tools

Scrutineer can ingest findings produced elsewhere so they enter the same triage and disclosure workflow:

    curl --data-binary @report.sarif http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/import

SARIF 2.1.0, CSV, markdown, and a minimal JSON shape are all accepted; the format is sniffed from the body. See [docs/import.md](docs/import.md) for the full request and response shape, the per-format field mapping, and how to add support for a new format.

## Navigating the UI

Every index page has a search box plus filter and sort dropdowns; the specifics vary by page. The sidebar sections:

- **Repositories** -- your scanned repos with language, last-scan status, and finding counts. Click into one for tabs covering Summary, Findings, Threat Model, Packages, Dependencies, Dependents, Advisories, Maintainers, Data, and Scans, plus an "Export report" button for a markdown rollup.
- **Organizations** -- repos, findings, and maintainers grouped by owning org, with per-org markdown exports.
- **Findings** -- every vulnerability across all repos. A finding page shows the six-step analysis (trace, boundary, validation, prior art, reach, rating), scoring fields, notes, communications log, references, labels, and a change history.
- **Packages** -- registry entries discovered across all repos.
- **Advisories** -- known CVEs and security advisories pulled for any scanned package.
- **Maintainers** -- people identified as maintainers, with their linked repos and findings.
- **SBOMs** -- uploaded CycloneDX/SPDX documents. Each component is resolved to a source repository and can be imported for scanning.
- **Audit** -- random sample of recent low and false-positive verdicts for spot-checking the cheap-classifier output. Each row records the analyst's agreement-or-overturn verdict, and a small dashboard shows the running overturn rate.
- **Scans** -- every scan that has run. Queued scans can be paused/resumed, running or queued scans can be cancelled and failed ones retried.
- **Skills** -- installed skills from disk and from the UI; view, edit, or run any of them.
- **Usage** -- token and cost totals across all scans, broken down by skill.
- **Settings** -- theme, colour scheme, model tiers, runner concurrency (restarts the runner to apply, cancelling in-flight scans) and default turn cap (applied to the next scan), plus system stats (record counts, DB size, paths).

## Finding workflow

Each finding from the `security-deep-dive` skill starts at **new** and moves through a guided workflow:

1. **new** -- just identified. High/Critical from `security-deep-dive` and every imported finding auto-enqueue a `revalidate` pass first, which records `true_positive` / `false_positive` / `already_fixed` / `uncertain` on the finding and (when true_positive on High/Critical) chains into `verify`. Outside that path: click "Verify" to trigger independent confirmation, "Skip to triage" if you trust the audit, or "Reject"
2. **enriched** -- verification ran. Review and click "Triage"
3. **triaged** -- confirmed real. Click "Prepare disclosure"
4. **ready** -- draft prepared. Run the `report-upstream` skill to file it via GitHub PVR (github.com only, requires `gh` auth), run `public-issue` for reviewed low-severity hardening findings that are safe to file publicly, or click "Mark as reported" after sending it yourself. When upstream has no PVR, follow the runbook in [docs/disclosure-fallback.md](docs/disclosure-fallback.md): route to a CNA when `cna-match` names one, otherwise contact the channel `maintainers` returned
5. **reported** -- sent to maintainer. Click "Acknowledged" when they respond
6. **acknowledged** -- maintainer working on fix. Click "Mark fixed" when it ships
7. **fixed** -- patch available. Click "Mark published" to issue the advisory
8. **published** -- done

Each finding page has a notes section for recording triage reasoning and communication history.

A `patch` run whose diff survives the applicability gate (the diff parses, targets files that exist, touches the flagged file, and passes `git apply --check`) is stored on the finding as `suggested_fix` with its base commit, downloadable from the finding page as a `.patch` file and included in markdown report exports. To revise a fix, push your edits to a branch, scan that branch (the Branch field, or a `/tree/<branch>` URL suffix), and run `patch` against the new scan: the diff is proposed against that ref's tree, so each round of edit, push, and rescan gets a fresh proposal on top of your work.

## Exploring dependencies

The Dependencies tab on a repo groups packages by name and shows all manifest files where each appears. It shows runtime dependencies by default, with a toggle for test/build/dev rows. The import button (arrow icon) next to a dependency resolves it to a repository URL via packages.ecosyste.ms and queues the full pipeline for it. Dependencies you've already imported show a link icon instead.

The same applies to the Dependents tab -- you can import any dependent's repository with one click.

## Docker

    docker build -t scrutineer .
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v scrutineer-data:/data \
      -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-... \
      -e ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://... \
      scrutineer

Or with a Claude Code OAuth token instead of an API key:

    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v scrutineer-data:/data \
      -e CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-... \
      scrutineer

Always bind to `127.0.0.1`. The UI has no authentication; binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes your findings database to anyone on the network.

If a container runtime (docker, rootless podman, or Apple's `container`) is available on the host, scrutineer runs each scan in an ephemeral container for isolation. The runner image is published to GHCR as a multi-arch manifest (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) and pulled automatically on first use:

    go run ./cmd/scrutineer -skills ./skills

Use `--runtime podman` to run scans under podman instead of docker (see [Podman (rootless)](#podman-rootless) below), `--runtime apple` to run scans under Apple's `container` runtime on macOS (see [Apple container (experimental)](#apple-container-experimental) below), `--no-container` to disable containerised execution entirely, or `--runner-image` to specify a different image. To build the runner locally instead of pulling from GHCR (use `podman build` or `container build` instead if you run scans under those runtimes):

    docker build -t scrutineer-runner -f Dockerfile.runner .
    go run ./cmd/scrutineer -skills ./skills --runner-image scrutineer-runner

The runner image is not auto-updated, so the analysis toolchain stays on whatever digest you pulled until you pull again. To keep that drift visible, scrutineer checks the registry once at startup (in the background, and failing silently if the registry is unreachable) and flags the runner image when it is more than seven days behind the published `:latest` -- both in the boot log and as a banner on the Settings page. Update with:

    docker pull ghcr.io/alpha-omega-security/scrutineer-runner:latest

If you would rather update automatically, run [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) against the runner image or pass `--pull=always` to the runtime; scrutineer deliberately does not pull on its own so a scan's toolchain only changes when you choose to update it.

When the container runner is active, scrutineer starts an authenticated egress proxy on the host and points `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` inside the container at it. The proxy only tunnels to an allowlist of hosts: the Anthropic API, `*.ecosyste.ms`, the major forges (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Bitbucket), common package registries (npm, PyPI, RubyGems, crates.io, Go module proxy, Packagist, Hex, NuGet), advisory sources (semgrep.dev, OSV, NVD, cwe.mitre.org), and the runtime's host endpoint (`host.docker.internal` for docker/podman, the default gateway IP for Apple's `container`) for the local skill API. Requests to anything else get a 403 and are logged. Extend the list with `egress_allow` in the config file. When `-anthropic-base-url` is set (or falls back to the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var), its hostname is automatically added to the allowlist. The proxy uses a per-process random token so it isn't an open relay; tools that ignore the proxy env are not blocked at the network layer (see `threatmodel.md`).

For deployments that treat skill prompts as untrusted, pass `--hardened` (or `hardened: true` in the config). The flag forces the container runner (`--no-container` is rejected), trims the egress allowlist to `*.anthropic.com` plus the host skill API (so `egress_allow` is ignored, drop the flag if you need to widen it), mounts the container rootfs read-only with `no-new-privileges`, attaches each scan to its own ephemeral network created with `--internal` (removed when the scan ends) so a process that ignores `HTTPS_PROXY` has no route out and concurrent scans cannot reach each other, and refuses scans whose workspace footprint exceeds 2 GiB once the clone completes. The 2 GiB check is post-clone: it bounds what hardened mode will agree to scan, not what can land on disk during the clone itself; use OS-level disk quotas if you need a clone-time guarantee. Bundled skills that hit ecosyste.ms or a package registry directly will fail under hardened mode unless they route through the host skill API. Per-ecosystem runner profiles still apply, but profile images that need writable paths beyond `/work` and `/tmp` are incompatible. Under rootless podman the proxy runs as a per-scan sidecar container on the `--internal` network (the host proxy is unreachable there; see [docs/podman.md](docs/podman.md)). Under podman, each hardened scan first verifies its `--internal` network actually blocks external egress while still reaching the egress proxy, and refuses the scan if that cannot be confirmed, so the sandbox never silently weakens.

## Podman (rootless)

Pass `--runtime podman` (or `runtime: podman` in the config) to run scans under podman instead of docker. Rootless podman is the recommended posture: because the runtime is not root-equivalent, a hostile repository that escapes the scan container lands as an unprivileged subordinate user rather than near-root on the host (see [threatmodel.md](threatmodel.md), T12). There is no auto-detection — a podman-only host must set `--runtime podman` explicitly; the default stays docker.

Requirements:

- **podman ≥ 4.7** — scrutineer reaches the host egress proxy via `--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway`, which older podman does not support; without it, scans fail with network errors. Startup logs a warning if the detected version looks too old or if the host-gateway address can't be resolved.
- **podman ≥ 5.0 (recommended for `--hardened`)** — the rootless egress proxy sidecar must reach the loopback-bound host skill API, which needs the network backend to forward host-gateway to the host loopback. podman ≥ 5.0 defaults to pasta (`--map-host-loopback`); older podman can work with a slirp4netns backend that has host-loopback enabled. Where unavailable, hardened scans are refused (fail closed). Startup warns on podman < 5.0 under `--hardened`. See [docs/egress-sidecar.md](docs/egress-sidecar.md).
- **`/etc/subuid` + `/etc/subgid`** — rootless podman maps the container user back to your host user with `--userns=keep-id` so scan output and the resumable session store stay host-owned. Your user needs a sub-id range (the usual `useradd` default provides one; run `podman system migrate` after changing it). Scrutineer runs a one-off keep-id smoke test at startup and fails fast with a hint if this is misconfigured.
- **`skopeo` (optional)** — used in place of `docker buildx` to notice when a moved `:latest` runner tag should rebuild per-ecosystem profile images. Without it, profiles still build but key their cache on the image ref alone.
- **SELinux** — on an SELinux-enabled host (the Fedora/RHEL/Rocky/Alma default) the runner relabels its bind mounts with `:z` so the container can read the clone and write its output; without it every scan fails with permission errors. This is handled automatically: `--selinux auto` (the default) detects the host, and a startup smoke test verifies a real relabeled mount works. Use `--selinux off` if you pre-label paths yourself, or `--selinux on` to force it. See [docs/podman.md](docs/podman.md#selinux-and-bind-mount-file-passing) for the `:z`-vs-`:Z` rationale.

`--hardened` is verified fail-closed per scan. Under **rootless podman** the scan can't route to a host proxy across the network-namespace boundary, so the egress proxy runs as a **per-scan sidecar container** on the `--internal` network — this makes enforced egress work under rootless. It requires a network backend that forwards host-gateway to the host loopback (modern pasta, default in podman ≥ 5.0, or slirp4netns with host-loopback); where that isn't available the sidecar can't reach the host skill API and the scan is refused (fail closed). Fall back to `--hardened-runtime-only` for the non-network half (read-only rootfs + `no-new-privileges` + the 2 GiB post-clone workspace cap), or use rootful podman/docker for `--hardened` without the host-loopback-forwarding requirement — the always-on `--cap-drop ALL` / non-root user / `/tmp` tmpfs / SELinux `:z` baseline applies in every mode regardless. See [docs/podman.md](docs/podman.md) for the full security model and [docs/egress-sidecar.md](docs/egress-sidecar.md) for the operator validation checklist.

The `docker build` / `docker run` commands shown in this repo -- for the runner image and the per-ecosystem profile images under `docker/profiles/` -- are CLI-compatible with podman; substitute `podman` for `docker`.

## Apple container (experimental)

Pass `--runtime apple` (or `runtime: apple` in the config) to run scans under Apple's [`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) runtime instead of docker. This path is explicit opt-in; the default stays docker and scrutineer does not auto-detect a docker-less Mac. It is labelled experimental because it is new and Apple's networking has known rough edges, not because of a capability gap: both ordinary and `--hardened` scans are supported.

Requirements and notes:

- **macOS 26 (Tahoe) on Apple silicon**: Apple supports `container` only on macOS 26 and will not address issues that cannot be reproduced there, so older macOS is out of scope.
- **Apple `container` with `container system start` running**: startup checks `container system status` and refuses the runtime if the service is unavailable.
- **Host gateway**: scrutineer starts its egress proxy on the host and points scan containers at the runtime's gateway IP, discovered from `/proc/net/route` inside the runner image. The proxy rewrites local skill-API requests back to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Hardened mode**: `--hardened` is supported. Each container runs in its own lightweight VM, so the VM boundary is the isolation; `container network create --internal` is a vmnet host-only network (egress blocked, host proxy reachable) and each hardened scan proves that fail-closed before running. The one `--hardened` flag Apple's CLI cannot set is `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, which the per-container VM boundary substitutes for (Apple's own untrusted-code sandbox hardens the same way). `--hardened-runtime-only` is a rootless-podman concept and is refused; use `--hardened`.

The `docker build` commands shown for the runner image and profiles can be run as `container build` when you use this runtime. See [docs/apple.md](docs/apple.md) for the full parity matrix, the VM-isolation security model, and how hardened mode works.

| `--runtime` | `docker` | Container runtime: `docker`, `podman` (rootless podman supported), or `apple` (Apple, experimental) |
| `--selinux` | `auto` | Bind-mount SELinux relabeling: `auto` (relabel when SELinux is detected), `on`, or `off` |
| `--no-container` | false | Disable the containerised runner; run claude directly on the host (no isolation). Deprecated alias: `--no-docker` |
| `--hardened` | false | Strict sandbox: container runtime required, egress restricted to `*.anthropic.com` + host skill API, read-only rootfs, internal network |
| `--hardened-runtime-only` | false | The non-network half of `--hardened` (read-only rootfs + `no-new-privileges` + 2 GiB workspace cap) **without** the per-scan `--internal` network; the rootless fallback for hosts where the `--hardened` egress sidecar can't run (implied by `--hardened`). Deprecated alias: `--hardened-rootless-runtime` |
| `--runner-image` | `ghcr.io/alpha-omega-security/scrutineer-runner:latest` | Container image for per-scan containers |
| `-concurrency` | `4` | Number of scans to run in parallel |
| `-clone` | `shallow` | Clone depth: `shallow` (`--depth 1`) or `full` |
| `-scan-timeout` | `1h` | Wall-clock limit per scan; exceeded scans fail |
| `-max-turns` | `0` | Passed as `--max-turns` to claude-code (0 = unlimited) |
| `-schema-strict` | `false` | Fail a scan when its `report.json` does not validate against the skill's `schema.json` (default: warn in the scan log and parse anyway) |
| `-anthropic-base-url` | - | Custom Anthropic API base URL (env: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) |

## Config file

Every flag above can be set in a YAML config file instead. The loader checks `./scrutineer.yaml` by default; override with `-config path/to/file`. Command-line flags always win. See [scrutineer.sample.yaml](scrutineer.sample.yaml) for the full shape.

The config file can also replace the model pick list and pin the fallback default model used by the high tier:

    default_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    models:
      - name: Sonnet 4.6
        id:   claude-sonnet-4-6
      - name: Opus
        id:   claude-opus-4-7

Scrutineer resolves skill models through tiers. Skills default to the `high` tier unless their `SKILL.md` metadata pins `scrutineer.model` to another tier or exact model id. Bundled lightweight skills such as `metadata` use `mid`, while `security-deep-dive` uses `max`. The Settings page lets you map each tier to any configured model.

## Sandboxed Claude Code configs

In `--no-container` mode the `claude` subprocess inherits your `~/.claude/settings.json`, so [sandbox settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing) that restrict network or filesystem access there will fail skills that need them. Point `claude` at a separate config directory just for scrutineer runs:

    CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-scrutineer go run ./cmd/scrutineer -skills ./skills

Copy your `settings.json` into that directory and drop the sandbox keys; your normal Claude Code config is untouched. Container mode is not affected: `claude` runs inside the container with its own environment regardless of the host config.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the reporting policy and [threatmodel.md](threatmodel.md) for the full threat model. The short version: scanning a repository is equivalent to running code from it. The containerised runner (when available) isolates each scan, but the default bare-metal mode runs everything as your user. Only scan repositories you'd be willing to clone and build locally.
