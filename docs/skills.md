# Skills

Every scan scrutineer runs is a [claude-code skill](https://agentskills.io): a directory containing a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter plus a markdown body), an optional `schema.json` describing the report it writes, and any helper scripts the body refers to. Scrutineer stages the skill into a workspace next to a clone of the target repository, invokes `claude -p` with the skill loaded, validates and parses whatever the skill wrote to its output file, and stores the result against the scan row.

Adding a scan type is a directory drop. No Go changes are needed unless you want a new typed parser for the output.

## Bundled skills

These ship in `skills/` and are loaded with `-skills ./skills`. The `triage` skill is the entry point: when a repository is added scrutineer enqueues `triage`, which classifies the repo with `brief` and enqueues the rest in parallel.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `triage` | Default pipeline orchestrator. Classifies the repo, enqueues the appropriate scan set via the scrutineer API, and re-verifies any findings already reported upstream. Edit its body to change what runs by default. |
| `metadata` | Fetches description, default branch, languages, license, stars, archived status, and icon from repos.ecosyste.ms. |
| `repo-overview` | Runs `brief --json` for a structured project summary used by other skills as orientation. |
| `packages` | Looks up every published package the repository produces across all registries, with download and dependent counts. |
| `advisories` | Fetches published GHSA and CVE records that affect any of those packages. |
| `dependents` | Top runtime dependents per published package, ranked, so reach analysis has a shortlist. |
| `dependencies` | Indexes every manifest and lockfile in the tree with `git-pkgs list`. |
| `sbom` | Generates a CycloneDX SBOM with `git-pkgs sbom`. |
| `subprojects` | Enumerates monorepo packages and workspaces so deep-dive scans can be scoped to a sub-path. |
| `maintainers` | Identifies who actually maintains the repo and the best contact route for a security report, distinguishing leads from drive-by contributors and bots. |
| `posture` | Scores readiness to receive a vulnerability report: SECURITY.md, private vulnerability reporting, prior advisories, scanning workflows. |
| `cna-match` | Matches the repository to its CVE Numbering Authority so disclosures route to the right contact. |
| `semgrep` | Runs semgrep with the `p/security-audit` and `p/secrets` rulesets and maps hits into the findings shape. |
| `zizmor` | Audits GitHub Actions workflows and maps hits into the findings shape. |
| `security-deep-dive` | The model-driven audit. Inventories trust boundaries and sinks, then runs a six-step trace/boundary/validate/prior-art/reach/rate analysis on each. |
| `reachability` | Traces sinks already found in this app's dependencies through the app's own code to see which are reachable from its trust boundaries. |
| `verify` | Re-checks one finding against current HEAD and records reproduces / fixed / cannot-reproduce. |
| `disclose` | Drafts a GHSA-shaped advisory (title, description, CVSS, CWEs, references) for one finding. |
| `patch` | Proposes a unified diff fixing one finding, written back as a note for analyst review. |
| `fork` | Forks the repository into the configured org, enables private vulnerability reporting on the fork, and files each finding as a draft advisory there. Only useful when `-fork-org` is set. |

The descriptions above are the first sentence of each skill's frontmatter `description`; the `/skills` page shows the full text.

## Directory layout

    skills/my-skill/
      SKILL.md          required
      schema.json       optional, JSON Schema for the output file
      scripts/          optional, helper programs the body invokes
      ...               anything else the body references

The loader walks each `-skills` directory looking for `SKILL.md` files up to six levels deep and skipping `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.venv`, and `__pycache__`. Each is parsed and upserted into the database keyed by `name`. A content hash over `SKILL.md` and `schema.json` decides whether the row's version is bumped on restart, so editing a skill's body and restarting is enough to roll out a change.

## Frontmatter

The `SKILL.md` frontmatter follows the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Spec violations (name format, field length) are warnings: the skill loads anyway and the warning is logged. The `scrutineer.*` keys under `metadata` are scrutineer's own and are checked strictly: an unknown key, an unrecognised `output_kind`, or an unsupported `scrutineer.version` is a hard error and stops server startup.

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: One paragraph saying what the skill does and when to use it.
license: MIT
compatibility: Tools and network access this skill assumes.
allowed-tools: Read,Write,Bash,WebFetch
metadata:

```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Skill identifier. Lowercase letters, digits, hyphens. Should match the directory name. |
| `description` | string | Required. Shown on `/skills` and used by claude when deciding whether the skill applies. |
| `license` | string | SPDX identifier. Informational. |
| `compatibility` | string | Free-text note on what the skill needs (binaries on PATH, network access, host APIs). Shown on `/skills`. |
| `allowed-tools` | string | Comma-separated claude-code tool names. Passed through to `claude --allowedTools`. Omit to allow the default set. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.version` | int | Schema version of the `scrutineer.*` keys themselves. This build accepts `1`. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.output_file` | string | Path, relative to the workspace, the skill writes its result to. Almost always `report.json`. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.output_kind` | string | Picks the parser scrutineer runs over `output_file` after the scan. See the table below. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.max_turns` | int | Per-skill cap on `claude --max-turns`. Overrides the global `-max-turns` flag for this skill only. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.model` | string | Model id from the configured list. Overrides the server default for this skill only. Ignored with a warning if not in the list. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.min_confidence` | `low` `medium` `high` | Findings below this confidence are dropped before they reach the database. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.report_on` | `Low` `Medium` `High` `Critical` | Lowest severity that produces a Finding row. Lower-severity hits are recorded on the scan but not surfaced. |
| `metadata.scrutineer.fail_on` | `Low` `Medium` `High` `Critical` | If any finding meets or exceeds this severity, the scan is marked failed. Useful for CI-style gating. |

`min_confidence`, `report_on`, and `fail_on` only apply when `output_kind` is `findings`.

## Output kinds

`scrutineer.output_kind` picks how scrutineer interprets `report.json` after the run.

| Kind | Stored as |
|---|---|
| `freeform` or empty | Raw text on the scan row. No further parsing. |
| `findings` | Parsed into Finding rows with fingerprint dedupe against prior scans. |
| `repo_metadata` | Repository row fields (description, languages, license, stars, archived). |
| `repo_overview` | Brief summary stored for other skills to read. |
| `packages` | Package rows. |
| `advisories` | Advisory rows. |
| `dependents` | Dependent rows. |
| `dependencies` | Dependency rows. |
| `maintainers` | Maintainer rows. |
| `subprojects` | Subproject rows for monorepo scoping. |
| `posture` | Posture tier and check results on the Repository row. |
| `verify` | Verification result and miss-count update on one Finding. |
| `patch` | Suggested-fix diff and base commit on one Finding. |

If you need an output shape that is not in this list, see "When you need Go changes" in [development.md](development.md). For most custom skills `freeform` (store the JSON as-is, render it on the scan's Data tab) or `findings` (surface as triaged vulnerabilities) is enough.

## The workspace at runtime

When a scan starts, the worker creates `./data/work/scan-{id}/` with:

    ./src/                       clone of the target repository at the requested ref
    ./context.json               who you are scanning and how to call scrutineer back
    ./.claude/skills/{name}/     this skill's SKILL.md, schema.json, and any aux files
    ./schema.json                copy of the skill's schema for the model to read
    ./report.json                the skill writes its output here

then runs `claude -p "Use the {name} skill in this workspace"` with the working directory set to the workspace root. Anything the skill writes outside `./report.json` is discarded when the workspace is cleaned. Write intermediate files under `./` rather than `/tmp`; concurrent scans share `/tmp` in the docker runner.

## context.json

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
    "name": "repo",
    "full_name": "owner/repo",
    "default_branch": "main"
  },
  "commit": "abc123",
  "packages": [
    {"name": "repo", "ecosystem": "npm", "purl": "pkg:npm/repo@1.0.0"}
  ],
  "scrutineer": {
    "api_base": "http://host.docker.internal:8080/api",
    "scan_id": 42,
    "token": "per-scan bearer, 32 random hex bytes",
    "repository_id": 7,
    "skill_id": 3,
    "finding_id": 19,
    "scan_ref": "release/2.x",
    "scan_subpath": "packages/core",
    "fork_org": "your-security-forks"
  }
}
```

`finding_id` is only present for finding-scoped skills (`verify`, `disclose`, `patch`). `scan_ref` is empty when the scan is on the default branch. `scan_subpath` is set when the operator scoped the scan to a monorepo sub-folder; skills that walk source honour it, skills that query external APIs by repository URL ignore it. `fork_org` is absent unless `-fork-org` is configured. `packages` is a convenience copy of the package rows when the `packages` skill has already run; otherwise it is omitted.

## schema.json

If a `schema.json` sits next to `SKILL.md`, scrutineer stages it into the workspace so the model can read the expected output shape, and after the run validates `report.json` against it with a draft 2020-12 validator. By default a mismatch is logged to the scan transcript and the parser still runs, so a stricter schema does not break ingestion. Start scrutineer with `-schema-strict` (or `schema_strict: true` in the config file) to turn that warning into a scan failure with the validator output in `Scan.Error`; useful while iterating on a skill locally.

Bundled skills with typed output kinds carry a schema; skills with `output_kind: freeform` generally do not.

## Calling scrutineer from a skill

`context.json` carries `scrutineer.api_base` and a per-scan bearer `scrutineer.token`. With those a skill can read prior scan results for the same repository, enqueue further scans, fetch maintainers, packages, advisories, dependents, and findings, and write notes and field updates back to a finding. The full surface is documented in [openapi.yaml](../openapi.yaml) at the repository root. The `triage` skill is the reference example for enqueueing; `disclose` and `patch` are the reference examples for finding writes.

The token is scoped to the scan's own repository: a skill cannot read or write rows belonging to other repositories.

## Loading skills

Skills are loaded at startup from any combination of:

- `-skills <dir>` (repeatable) for local directories,
- `-skills-repo <https-url>` to clone a git repository of skills on startup,
- the `/skills` page in the UI to create or edit a skill in the browser.

A skill loaded from disk replaces any UI-edited skill of the same name on the next restart. Disable a skill on `/skills` to keep it in the database but reject any attempt to run it.
