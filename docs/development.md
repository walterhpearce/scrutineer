    govulncheck ./...
    deadcode ./...

## Adding a new scan type

Scans are claude-code skills on disk; adding one is a directory drop, no Go change. The frontmatter reference, `scrutineer.*` metadata keys, output kinds, workspace layout, `context.json` shape, and schema validation are documented in [skills.md](skills.md).

### When you do need Go changes

- **New output kind**: add the kind to `OutputKinds` in `internal/skills/parse.go`, add a `parseXOutput` method in `internal/worker/skill_parsers.go`, and add a case to the switch in `internal/worker/skill.go`. Without the `OutputKinds` entry the bundled-skills test rejects the SKILL.md at startup.
- **New API surface** for skills to read: add a handler in `internal/web/api_reads.go` and a route in `internal/web/api.go`, then document it in `openapi.yaml`.

## Regenerating cwe.json

The CWE catalogue is distilled from MITRE's CSV download:

    curl -sS https://cwe.mitre.org/data/csv/1000.csv.zip | funzip > /tmp/cwe.csv
    python3 -c 'import csv,json; print(json.dumps({"CWE-"+r["CWE-ID"]:{"name":r["Name"],"description":r["Description"].strip()} for r in csv.DictReader(open("/tmp/cwe.csv"))}, separators=(",",":"), sort_keys=True))' > internal/web/cwe.json

## Frontend assets

Tailwind, basecoat, htmx, lucide and highlight.js are vendored under `internal/web/static/vendor/` and embedded into the binary so the UI works offline. To bump a version, edit the pinned URL in `scripts/vendor-assets.sh`, re-run it, update the matching filename in `internal/web/templates/layout.html`, and commit the changed files.

    ./scripts/vendor-assets.sh

## SSE architecture

The `Broker` in `sse.go` fans events from the worker to connected browsers. Clients subscribe via `GET /events?scan={id}&repo={id}` (both optional). The worker publishes two event types:

- `scan-log`: each line from a running job, pushed immediately
- `scan-status`: fires when a job finishes (done/failed)

Templates use `hx-ext="sse"` with `sse-connect` and `sse-swap` to append log lines and trigger page reloads on completion. Embedded newlines in log lines are emitted as multiple `data:` lines so the browser's EventSource parser reconstructs the original text.

## Skill HTTP API

`/api` is a bearer-authenticated surface that running skills call back into. Each scan gets a random token on enqueue; the worker writes it into the workspace's `context.json`. Middleware (`apiAuth`) validates the token against the active scan row and enforces that a scan only touches resources on its own repository.

See `openapi.yaml` at the repo root for the full surface. The `triage` bundled skill is the reference example.

## Finding workflow tables

Mutable fields on `Finding` (status, severity, resolution, CVE/CVSS fields, etc.) all write through `db.WriteFindingField`, which logs every change to `FindingHistory` with a source tag (`tool`, `model_suggested`, `analyst`). Skill writes come through the API with `source=model_suggested`; browser-form writes use `source=analyst`. Notes, communications, references, and labels are stored in sibling tables rather than blob columns.

## Security hardening

See [threatmodel.md](../threatmodel.md) for the full model. Key mitigations in the code:

- `securityHeaders` middleware on browser routes: host header check (localhost only) + `Sec-Fetch-Site` on POST
- `/api/*` skips browser CSRF but requires a per-scan bearer token (random 32-byte hex)
- `validateGitURL`: https-only, `--` separator, `GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER=0`
- `io.LimitReader` on the one remaining upstream HTTP call (10 MB cap); skills do their own fetching
- Data directory created with mode `0700`
- `SameSite=Strict` on cookies
