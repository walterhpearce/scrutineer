# Database schema

SQLite with WAL mode. GORM handles migrations on startup. The queue table (`goqite`) is managed separately with an embedded SQL schema.

See [backup.md](backup.md) for backing up and restoring this file: WAL mode means a plain `cp` can be inconsistent, so use `scrutineer backup`/`restore` or one of the documented strategies.

## repositories

The central entity. One row per git URL.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | integer PK | |

Refreshed by the worker after each scan and backfilled once at startup; 0 for local repos and remote repos not scanned since the column was added. |
| threat_model | text | Operator's working-copy threat-model JSON. When set, the worker writes it to `./threat_model.json` in every skill workspace and `security-deep-dive` loads it instead of fetching the latest `threat-model` scan. Edited via the threat-model workbench tab. Empty = no override. |
| created_at | datetime | |
| updated_at | datetime | |

## scans

One row per skill execution or external import. `skill_name` / `skill_version` pin which skill ran; for imports `skill_name` records the originating tool.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | integer PK | |
| repository_id | integer FK | References `repositories.id`. Cascade delete. |
| kind | text | `skill` for native scans, `import` for findings ingested via `POST /api/v1/import`. |
| status | text | `queued`, `paused`, `running`, `done`, `failed`, `cancelled`. Stale `running` rows are swept to `failed` on startup. |
| status_priority | integer | Denormalised sort key for the scans index: 0 running, 1 queued, 2 paused, 3 terminal. |
| model | text | Claude model ID resolved from the explicit scan model, skill model preference, or skill default model tier at enqueue time. |
| effort | text | Claude `--effort` level (`low`–`max`) snapshotted from the runtime setting at enqueue. Empty on legacy rows; the runner falls back to its configured default. |
| skill_id | integer FK | References `skills.id`. Null for legacy non-skill rows. |
| skill_version | integer | Version of the skill at run time; the skill row's `version` bumps on every edit so older scans stay readable. |
| skill_name | text | Denormalised skill name for UI display. |
| finding_id | integer FK | Set when the scan is finding-scoped (verify/patch/disclose/exposure). References `findings.id`. |
| dependent_id | integer FK | Set on `exposure` scans only. References `dependents.id`; identifies which downstream consumer the skill is auditing for reachability of the upstream finding. |
| baseline_scan_id | integer FK | Set on a fix-validation scan (`POST /repositories/{id}/validate-fix`). References the baseline `scans.id` the fix ref is diffed against. Marks the scan as a validation anchor (the auto triage funnel skips it) and, when it finalises, drives the fingerprint diff written back to `report`. Null on ordinary scans. |
| api_token | text | Per-scan bearer token that the skill presents when calling `/api`. Only valid while the scan is running. |
| ref | text | Git ref to checkout after cloning. Empty means the default branch. |
| skills_repo_sha | text | Commit of `-skills-repo` resolved at startup and stamped on every skill scan. Empty when `-skills-repo` is unset or for `import` scans. |
| sub_path | text | Scopes code analysis to a sub-folder of the clone (monorepo packages). Empty means repo root. |
| profile | text | Runner profile that ran the scan (e.g. `php`). Empty = the default runner image. Set explicitly via `?profile=` or auto-detected from the clone by `brief` before launch; persisted so retries reuse the choice. |
| commit | text | Git HEAD at scan time. |
| started_at | datetime | |
| finished_at | datetime | |
| cost_usd | real | From claude's `total_cost_usd` in stream-json result. |
| turns | integer | Number of claude turns. |
| input_tokens | integer | Input tokens billed. |
| output_tokens | integer | Output tokens billed. |
| cache_read_tokens | integer | `cache_read_input_tokens` from the result event. |
| cache_write_tokens | integer | `cache_creation_input_tokens` from the result event. |
| max_turns_hit | boolean | True when the scan is `done` with partial output because Claude hit the configured max-turns cap. Such scans keep their session id so Retry can resume. |
| prompt | text | Activation prompt sent to claude. The skill body lives in the Skill row, not here. |
| report | text | The skill's primary output. JSON for parsed kinds, freeform for everything else. On a fix-validation anchor (`baseline_scan_id` set) it is replaced, once the scan finalises, by the JSON validation report: the resolved/surviving/new fingerprint diff against the baseline plus the finding-scoped verify verdicts. |
| log | text | Line-by-line transcript of the scan. Streamed to the UI via SSE. |
| error | text | Error message if the scan failed. |
| findings_count | integer | Denormalised count of findings parsed from the report. |
| created_at | datetime | |
| updated_at | datetime | |

## skills

One row per installed skill. Loaded from `skills/` directories on disk or the UI. Editing a skill creates no new row but bumps `version`.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | integer PK | |
| name | text, unique | Matches SKILL.md `name` frontmatter. |
| description | text | |
| license | text | |
| compatibility | text | |
| allowed_tools | text | From SKILL.md `allowed-tools`. |
| metadata | text | Raw frontmatter metadata map as JSON. Scrutineer reads `scrutineer.output_file` and `scrutineer.output_kind` from here. |
| body | text | Markdown body after the frontmatter. The prompt. |
| schema_json | text | Optional schema.json contents. |
| output_file | text | Relative path the skill writes to. Promoted from metadata. |
| output_kind | text | Parser key: `findings`, `maintainers`, `packages`, `advisories`, `dependencies`, `finding_dedup`, `repo_metadata`, `repo_overview`, `subprojects`, `posture`, `verify`, `patch`, `threat_model`, `exposure`, `freeform`. Promoted from metadata. |
| version | integer | Bumps on every save. |
| active | boolean | |
| requires_remote | boolean | When true, scrutineer refuses to enqueue this skill against a local-directory repository (file:// URL). Set via `scrutineer.requires_remote: true` in SKILL.md frontmatter. Use for skills that depend on a forge URL or remote-only data (advisories, exposure, fork, maintainers, metadata, packages, report-upstream). |
| requires_profile | text | Constrains the skill to a single registered runner profile (e.g. `php`). Empty means no constraint. Set via `scrutineer.requires_profile` in SKILL.md frontmatter. Enqueue returns 400 when the requested profile mismatches; the worker fails the scan when auto-detection resolves to a different profile. |
| paths | text | Newline-joined shell-glob allow-list from `scrutineer.paths`. When non-empty, the skill sees only matching files inside the workspace `src/` and the builtin skip list is bypassed. |
| ignore_paths | text | Newline-joined shell-glob deny-list from `scrutineer.ignore_paths`. Always layered on top of the active include set. |
| source | text | `local`, `remote`, or `ui`. |
| source_path | text | Directory on disk (for local/remote). Empty for UI-created. |
| source_hash | text | sha256 of SKILL.md + schema.json. Used by the loader to detect changes. |
| created_at | datetime | |
| updated_at | datetime | |

## findings

One row per vulnerability. Lifecycle columns are mutated through `db.WriteFindingField`, which logs every change to `finding_history`.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | integer PK | |
| scan_id | integer FK | The scan that first produced this finding. Cascade delete. |
| repository_id | integer FK | Denormalised from scan so list queries skip the join. |
| commit | text | Denormalised from scan. |
| sub_path | text | Denormalised from scan; sub-folder the finding's `location` is relative to. |
| fingerprint | text | Content hash for cross-scan dedupe; `(repository_id, fingerprint)` is indexed. |
| last_seen_scan_id | integer | Most recent scan that re-observed this fingerprint. |
| last_seen_commit | text | Commit at re-observation. |
| seen_count | integer | Total times re-observed across rescans. |
| missed_count | integer | Consecutive same-skill rescans where the fingerprint did not reappear; reset on next re-observation. Non-zero is a hint the issue may be fixed upstream. |
| last_missed_scan_id | integer | Scan where it most recently went missing. |
| finding_id | text | ID within the originating report, e.g. `F1`. |
| sinks | text | Comma-joined sink IDs. Links to the threat model tab. |

| cwe | text | e.g. `CWE-352`. Tooltips come from the embedded MITRE catalogue. |
| location | text | Primary `file:line` or `file:start-end`. |
| locations | text | Newline-joined set of every `file:line` that hit the same fingerprint in this scan. `location` is the first; the rest render as a `+N` badge and an expandable list on the finding page. Empty on rows that predate the column until the next rescan. |
| snippet | text | Source excerpt around `location` (a few lines either side), captured at ingest while the scanned checkout is still on disk. Renders as a fenced code block in the markdown report. Empty for rows written before the column, locations without a line, or paths that did not resolve to a readable file in the checkout; not backfilled. Refreshed on re-observation, never wiped when a later scan cannot recompute it. |
| reachability | text | `reachable`, `harness_only`, `unclear`. `harness_only` is a real bug but not disclosable as a vulnerability on its own. |
| quality_tier | text | `high` (heap overflow, UAF, type confusion, controllable write, shell/eval injection) or `low` (stack exhaustion, assertion failure, fixed-offset null deref, log injection). |
| imported_from | text | Originating tool name when the finding came in via `POST /api/v1/import`; empty for native scans. |
| affected | text | Version range, e.g. `>=0.2.0, <=4.0.5`. |
| cve_id | text | e.g. `CVE-2026-12345`. |
| ghsa_id | text | GitHub Security Advisory id, e.g. `GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`; set once the advisory is published on GitHub. |
| cvss_vector | text | CVSS v3.x base vector, e.g. `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/...`. |
| cvss_score | real | Derived from `cvss_vector` on write. Cleared when the vector is empty or unparseable. |
| cvss_v4_vector | text | CVSS v4.0 base vector, e.g. `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`. Stored independently of `cvss_vector` because the v4 metric set and scoring formula differ. |
| cvss_v4_score | real | Derived from `cvss_v4_vector` on write. Cleared on empty/unparseable, same as the v3 score. |
| fix_version | text | |
| fix_commit | text | |
| release_tag | text | Tag of the upstream release that first contained the fix (e.g. `v2.3.1`). Set by the release-watch skill once `status=fixed`. |
| release_url | text | Permalink to the release page. |
| released_at | datetime | When the release was published upstream. Together with `release_tag` and `release_url`, these close the gap between fix-landed and fix-shipped for the metrics in dora-metrics. |
| resolution | text | `fix`, `migrate`, `workaround`, `adopt`, `wontfix`. |
| disclosure_draft | text | Draft advisory text. |
| assignee | text | Free-text. |
| suggested_fix | text | Unified diff from the `patch` skill that passed the applicability gate. Empty when no patch run or the gate rejected it. |
| suggested_fix_commit | text | Sha the suggested_fix applies cleanly against. |
| breaking_change | text | `breaking`, `non_breaking`, or `unknown`; verdict of the `breaking-change` skill on the suggested fix. Empty when the skill has not run. |
| breaking_change_rationale | text | Human-readable rationale plus the list of affected dependents from the same skill run. |
| exploited_in_wild | text | Analyst's call: `yes`, `no`, or empty (unknown). On the OSS-SIRT intake list; surfaced on the finding page, in the OSV `database_specific` block, in the CSAF audit notes, and in the markdown report. Automation never writes this. |
| exploited_in_wild_evidence | text | Free-text source note: researcher, ticket link, traffic observation. |
| mitigation | text | Markdown body from the `mitigate` skill: workarounds consumers can apply before the fix ships, plus detection guidance. |
| mitigation_semgrep | text | Optional YAML semgrep rule from the same skill that flags the vulnerable pattern. Empty when no rule was warranted. |
| last_revalidate_verdict | text | Cached latest verdict from the `revalidate` skill (`true_positive`, `false_positive`, `already_fixed`, `uncertain`). Indexed so the audit queue can filter without scanning `finding_notes`. Empty when revalidate has not run on this finding. |
| trace | text | Step 1 prose. Markdown. |
| boundary | text | Step 2. |
| validation | text | Step 3: reproduction. |
| prior_art | text | Step 4. |
| reach | text | Step 5: dependent exposure. |
| rating | text | Step 6: severity justification. |
