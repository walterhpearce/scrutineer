## scans

One row per skill execution or external import. `skill_name` / `skill_version` pin which skill ran; for imports `skill_name` records the originating tool.

| description | text | |
| license | text | |

| last_seen_commit | text | Commit at re-observation. |
| seen_count | integer | Total times re-observed across rescans. |
