// Prereq gating for skill jobs. A skill declaring scrutineer.requires
// only dispatches when each named upstream skill has a completed scan
// for the same repository; otherwise the job is re-published with a
// delay so the runner picks it up again later.
//
// "Satisfied" is currently any done scan on this repository, regardless
// of commit. URL-keyed skills (packages, advisories, maintainers,
// metadata) do not have a commit identity, so a uniform
// rule across all prereqs avoids special cases. Triage's commit-aware
// skip set covers the redo-on-new-commit case at a different layer.
//
// A prereq with no scan rows at all on the repository is treated as
// satisfied: triage (or the operator) decided not to enqueue it, and
// waiting would deadlock the
// dependent skill. The same applies to a prereq skill that is not
// registered or is disabled. A prereq that has been enqueued for the
// repository but has no done scan yet defers the job while one is
// still in flight (queued/running/paused); when every attempt has
// reached a terminal failed/cancelled state the dependent fails
// immediately rather than burning the retry budget waiting on
// something that will not recover on its own.
