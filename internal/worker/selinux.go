// SELinux bind-mount relabeling. On hosts with SELinux enabled -- the default on
// Fedora, RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky and Alma, which is where rootless podman
// most often runs -- the scan container runs as the confined type `container_t`
// while bind-mounted host paths keep their own labels (user_home_t, var_lib_t,
// ...). The base container-selinux policy denies container_t access to those
// types, so without intervention the runner cannot read the clone at /work or
// /src and cannot write its output: every scan fails with EACCES even though the
// uid/gid (DAC) ownership is correct. This file owns the engine-agnostic
// detection and the decision to append the ":z" relabel option that fixes it.
//
// This is orthogonal to --userns=keep-id (runtime.go): keep-id fixes DAC
// ownership of bind-mount writes; relabeling fixes SELinux/MAC access. A
// rootless-podman scan on an enforcing host needs both.

// an SELinux host gets "src:dst:ro,z" while every other host gets the spec
// unchanged.
//
// Why ":z" (shared) and not ":Z" (private):
//
//   - Host read-back. After a scan the scrutineer host process reads the output
//     report back out of /work (readCappedReport). ":z" relabels to the shared
//     type container_file_t with no MCS category, so the host can still read it;
//     ":Z" stamps a private per-container category that a host process in a
//     confined SELinux domain could be denied -- locking scrutineer out of the
//     very report it asked for.
//   - Overlapping mounts. /work and /src point at the same clone tree; one
//     shared label keeps the two relabels consistent instead of churning a
//     private category between them.
//   - Isolation model. scrutineer separates scans with per-scan work roots and,
//     under --hardened, per-scan --internal networks -- not SELinux MCS. ":Z"'s
//     extra container-to-container separation is not load-bearing here. The cost
//     ":z" accepts is that any container_t on the host could read a scan's
//     ephemeral workspace; that is outside the threat model (the concern is a
//     hostile repo escaping the sandbox, not a sibling local container reading a
//     throwaway clone).
//
// Operators who want the stricter per-scan MCS isolation can pre-label their data
// dir and run with --selinux=off; ":Z" is intentionally not exposed as a switch
// so the host read-back guarantee stays simple.

// disabled it is a no-op: the operator has taken ownership of labeling, and a
// fresh unlabeled temp dir would be a misleading probe (it would fail even where
