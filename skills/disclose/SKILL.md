# disclose

Draft disclosure content for an existing finding in a shape that maps one-to-one to GitHub's repository security advisory (GHSA) form. You are not deciding whether the bug is real — the triage and verify skills did that. Your job is to turn a confirmed finding into text a maintainer can paste into `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/security/advisories/new`, or that a caller can POST to `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories`.

## Workspace

- `./src` — the repository at its current HEAD, so you can link to file:line and read tag history
- `./context.json` — has `scrutineer.api_base`, `scrutineer.token`, `scrutineer.repository_id`, and `scrutineer.finding_id` (required; this skill only makes sense finding-scoped)
- `./report.json` — write a GHSA-shaped record of what you drafted
- `./schema.json` — shape of `report.json`

## What to do

1. Read `./context.json`. If `scrutineer.finding_id` is missing, write `{"error": "no finding_id in context.json; disclose is finding-scoped"}` to `report.json` and exit 0.

2. Fetch the finding: `GET {api_base}/findings/{finding_id}` with `Authorization: Bearer {token}`. You get title, severity, cwe (comma-joined), location, affected, cvss_vector, cve_id, fix_version, fix_commit, and the six-step prose (trace, boundary, validation, prior_art, reach, rating). Also fetch:
   - `GET {api_base}/repositories/{repository_id}` for the upstream URL and default branch
   - `GET {api_base}/repositories/{repository_id}/packages` for the list of published packages; you need this to fill GHSA's affected-package block

3. Compose the GHSA fields below. Every field names the GHSA REST key (`summary`, `description`, `vulnerabilities`, etc.) so the mapping is explicit. Keep each one factual and derived from the finding — do not invent details the audit did not establish.

   **`summary` (title).** A single sentence, under 80 characters. Start with the impact verb ("Arbitrary file write in …", "Prototype pollution in …"), not the package name. Reuse the finding's `title` if it already fits that shape.

   **`description` (markdown body).** This is the main document a maintainer reads. Structure as below. Each section is required unless marked optional.

   ```
   ## Summary

   Two or three sentences describing the vulnerability in the maintainer's own domain terms. Repeat the one-line summary then expand.

   ## Impact

   What an attacker can do. Stay tight — reuse the Rating prose if it already covers this. Name the attacker model (unauthenticated remote, local, authenticated user) in the first sentence.

   ## Affected versions

   A line per affected range, matching the `vulnerabilities[].vulnerable_version_range` values. Example:
   - `>= 1.0, < 2.3.1` (all pre-2.3.1 releases)

   ## Patched versions

   If a fix has shipped, list the first patched version. Otherwise write "Not yet patched" and state whether the `fix_commit` on the finding is on the default branch.

   ## Proof of concept

   Reuse the Validation prose, formatted as a short runnable recipe. Include the minimum needed to trigger the bug. A fenced code block when a script exists.

   ## Fix suggestion

   One or two sentences on where the guard belongs (sanitise here, validate there, remove the sink). Do not claim a specific patch unless the Trace identifies the exact line.

   ## References

   - `{repo.html_url}/blob/{default_branch}/{location}` — the vulnerable code
   - `https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/{n}.html` — one line per CWE
   - any URL that appeared verbatim in the prior_art field of the finding
   ```

   GHSA's REST endpoint has no structured references field — all URLs live inside the description markdown. You will still post them as scrutineer references (step 4) so the UI surfaces them as links, but the maintainer-facing copy is the markdown list.

   **`vulnerabilities[]` (affected products).** One entry per published package. Build from the repository's packages list. Each entry has:

   ```json
   {
     "package": { "ecosystem": "<ghsa-ecosystem>", "name": "<package-name>" },
     "vulnerable_version_range": ">= 1.0, < 2.3.1",
     "patched_versions": "2.3.1",
     "vulnerable_functions": ["pkg.Parse", "pkg.ParseFile"]
   }
   ```

   Normalise the ecosystem string to the exact GHSA enum — all lowercase, with these specific spellings: `rubygems` (not `RubyGems`), `npm`, `pip` (not `pypi` or `PyPI`), `maven`, `nuget`, `composer`, `go`, `rust`, `erlang`, `actions`, `pub`, `swift`, `other`. If a scrutineer package has `ecosystem: "Packagist"`, emit `"composer"`; if `"Cargo"`, emit `"rust"`. Map anything unrecognised to `"other"`.

   If the repository has no packages, emit a single placeholder entry `[{"package": {"ecosystem": "other", "name": "{owner}/{repo}"}}]` and note in the `notes` field of `report.json` that this advisory is source-only. GitHub's REST endpoint rejects a body with no `vulnerabilities` entry, and the `ghsa` block in `report.json` is meant to be POSTable as-is.

   `vulnerable_functions` is optional; fill it only when the Trace field names specific exported symbols (e.g. `pkg.Foo`, `Class#method`). Leave empty otherwise.

   **`severity` / `cvss_vector_string`.** GHSA accepts exactly one of the two; prefer the CVSS vector when you can derive one confidently, fall back to the severity label otherwise.

   Use CVSS 3.1. Derive each metric from the finding prose: `AV` from the attack surface described in Boundary, `AC` from how contrived the trigger is in Validation, `PR`/`UI` from whether the trigger needs authentication or human interaction, `S` from whether the impact crosses a trust boundary, and `C`/`I`/`A` from the dangerous behaviour in Rating. Write the full vector string (e.g. `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`). If any single metric cannot be derived from the prose, do not guess a value for it; omit `cvss_vector_string` entirely and emit the `severity` label instead.

   For the severity label fallback, map scrutineer's `severity` field (`Critical`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low`) to GHSA's lowercase `critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`. If the finding has a pre-existing `cvss_vector`, leave it alone and reuse it here — do not overwrite analyst edits.

   **`cwe_ids[]`.** Split the finding's comma-joined `cwe` field into an array of `CWE-N` strings (GHSA accepts multiple). Do not invent CWEs not in the finding.

   **`cve_id`.** Pass through whatever the finding carries; leave blank (omit the key) if unset. CVE IDs are assigned by a CNA, not drafted — do not fabricate one.

   **`credits[]`.** Omit unless the finding prose explicitly attributes the discovery (e.g. a prior_art reference to a named researcher). Leave empty by default.

4. Write the composed pieces back via the scrutineer API.

   **PATCH the finding** — `PATCH {api_base}/findings/{finding_id}` with `Authorization: Bearer {token}` and JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "fields": {
       "title": "<summary>",
       "cvss_vector": "CVSS:3.1/...",
       "affected": ">=1.0, <2.3.1",
       "fix_version": "2.3.1",
       "disclosure_draft": "<description markdown>"
     },
     "by": "disclose"
   }
   ```

   Only include fields you want to change. If the finding already had a non-empty `cvss_vector`, `affected`, `fix_version`, or `title`, leave those keys out of the body so the analyst's value is preserved. `disclosure_draft` may be overwritten — a re-run is allowed to produce a fresh draft.

   **POST each reference** — for every URL cited in the description, `POST {api_base}/findings/{finding_id}/references` with:

   ```json
   { "url": "https://...", "tags": "upstream|cwe|prior-art", "summary": "short label" }
   ```

   Before posting, `GET {api_base}/findings/{finding_id}/references` and skip URLs that already exist — re-runs should not create duplicates.

5. Write `./report.json`. The top-level `ghsa` block is the drop-in body for `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories`; an operator or downstream skill can submit it as-is.

   ```json
   {
     "ghsa": {
       "summary": "...",
       "description": "...",
       "vulnerabilities": [
         {
           "package": { "ecosystem": "go", "name": "example.com/pkg" },
           "vulnerable_version_range": ">= 1.0, < 2.3.1",
           "patched_versions": "2.3.1",
           "vulnerable_functions": ["pkg.Parse"]
         }
       ],
       "cwe_ids": ["CWE-22"],
       "cvss_vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/...",
       "cve_id": null,
       "credits": []
     },
     "patched": ["cvss_vector", "affected", "fix_version", "disclosure_draft"],
     "preserved": ["title"],
     "references_added": 3,
     "references_skipped": 1,
     "notes": "short prose about anything non-obvious: no published packages (source-only advisory), an ambiguous tag range, a missing prior-art link, etc."
   }
   ```

   `ghsa` mirrors the GHSA REST body: every key is drawn from GitHub's repository-advisories schema, so downstream code can POST it without a translation step. `patched` lists fields you actually sent in the PATCH /findings body. `preserved` lists fields you chose not to touch because the analyst had already set them.

## Constraints

- Do not mark the finding as `ready` — lifecycle transitions belong to the analyst. Your output is input for their review, not a replacement for it.
- Do not post communications. `POST /findings/{id}/communications` records maintainer contact, which this skill has not made.
- Do not fabricate a CVE ID, a CWE, a credit, or a vulnerable function name. Every value in the `ghsa` block must be derivable from the finding, the repo, or the packages list.
- Do not emit `severity` and `cvss_vector_string` together — GHSA rejects the pair. Prefer the CVSS vector; use `severity` only when you cannot derive a vector.
- If the finding prose is too thin to draft from (empty Trace, empty Validation), write `{"error": "finding {id} has insufficient prose to draft disclosure"}` to `report.json` and exit 0. Do not PATCH anything.
