# sbom

## Workspace

- `./src` — the cloned repository
- `./scripts/generate.sh` — the wrapper script
- `./report.json` — write the SBOM here

## Available scripts

- `scripts/generate.sh` — runs `git-pkgs sbom --format json` inside `./src` and emits the CycloneDX JSON document to stdout.

## What to do

```bash
bash scripts/generate.sh > ./report.json
```

If the script exits non-zero, write `{"error": "<stderr message>"}` to `./report.json` so the failure is visible on the scan page.

The output is consumed as freeform (stored verbatim; no post-processing) so the CycloneDX document is preserved exactly as git-pkgs produced it.
