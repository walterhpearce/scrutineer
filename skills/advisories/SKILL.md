# advisories

## Workspace

- `./context.json` — has `repository.url`
- `./report.json` — write the advisories array here
- `./schema.json` — output shape

## What to do

1. Read `./context.json` and extract `repository.url`.
2. Fetch `https://advisories.ecosyste.ms/api/v1/advisories?repository_url={URL-ENCODED_URL}`. Follow pagination (`Link: <...>; rel="next"`) if present.
3. For each advisory returned, emit one entry in `report.json` under `advisories`:
   - `uuid` from upstream `uuid`
   - `url` from upstream `url` (or the first reference if `url` is empty)
   - `title` from upstream `title`
   - `description` from upstream `description`
   - `severity` from upstream `severity` (upper-case, e.g. `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)
   - `cvss_score` from upstream `cvss_score` (number; omit if absent)
   - `classification` from upstream `classification` (e.g. CWE id)
   - `packages` — comma-joined list of affected package names upstream lists under `packages` or `package_names`
   - `published_at` and `withdrawn_at` as RFC3339 strings if upstream has them

Return `{"advisories": []}` if upstream has nothing — valid result.
