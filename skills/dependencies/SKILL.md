# dependencies

Wrap `git-pkgs list --format json` so scrutineer can read the result as a dependencies report.

## Workspace

- `./src` — the cloned repository
- `./scripts/index.sh` — the wrapper script
- `./report.json` — write the final report here
- `./schema.json` — output shape

## Available scripts

- `scripts/index.sh` — runs `git-pkgs init` then `git-pkgs list --format json` inside `./src` and wraps the array in `{"dependencies": [...]}`.

## What to do

Run the script and capture its stdout as the report:

```bash
bash scripts/index.sh > ./report.json
```

If the script exits non-zero, read its stderr, then write a short `{"dependencies": [], "error": "..."}` document to `./report.json` so the caller sees why no dependencies were indexed.

The wrapper already emits the exact schema the parser expects — no post-processing needed.
